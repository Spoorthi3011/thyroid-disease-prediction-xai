# Thyroid Disease Prediction with Explainable AI

This project applies machine learning (Random Forest and SVM) with LIME interpretability to predict thyroid disease using a medical dataset.

## 📄 Overview
- Predicts thyroid conditions based on features like TSH, T3, T4, age, and gender.
- Compares performance of Random Forest and SVM classifiers.
- Uses LIME to interpret and visualize predictions.

## 📊 Results
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 100%
- **SVM Accuracy:** 93.81%

## 🧠 Explainability
LIME was used to highlight the most important features contributing to model decisions.
